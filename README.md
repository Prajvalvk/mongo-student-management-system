# mongo-student-management-system
Core Functionality:

Server and Framework Setup:
The file sets up an Express server (a popular web framework in Node.js) that handles HTTP requests.

MongoDB Connection via Mongoose:
It establishes a connection to a local or cloud MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapper). Mongoose simplifies interactions with MongoDB, letting you define data schemas and models to structure your data.

Student Schema & Model:
A Mongoose schema for "Student" is defined (likely in a separate module, such as models/student.js), representing each student with properties like name, roll number, class, section, etc.

REST API Endpoints:
Common routes exposed by app3.js include:

POST /students: To add a new student to the database.

GET /students: To retrieve a list of all students.

GET /students/:id: To retrieve a specific student by ID.

PUT /students/:id: To update a studentâ€™s record.

DELETE /students/:id: To delete a student from the database.

Middleware:
The file configures middleware such as express.json() to parse incoming JSON request bodies.

App Listen:
The Express app listens on a specified port, allowing clients (like a frontend app or Postman) to interact with the server.

Purpose:

The app3.js file acts as the main API layer for the Student Management System, handling data storage, retrieval, updates, and deletions of student records in MongoDB.

How to Use:

Start a MongoDB server.

Run app3.js (typically using node app3.js).

Use API testing tools (like Postman) or a frontend app to interact with the student database using the defined API endpoints.

Summary:
app3.js is a backend node application for managing students (add/view/update/delete) with MongoDB as a database, using Express for routing and Mongoose for data modeling. The code structure and endpoints match standard practices for CRUD-based student or content management systems
